# Mission Statement
Medical results from genetic tests are unique in healthcare because the results of one individual might be useful or important to the healthcare of relatives. When genetic results are shared among relatives, it may lead to greater awareness and protections against inherited diseases or disorders. University of Washington faculty built ShareDNA, free software that runs on a smart phone, to allow you to easily share your genetic test results with anyone of your choice. This app is for anyone interested in sharing their genetic results.
